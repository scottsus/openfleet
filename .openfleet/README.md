# ⛴️ Openfleet

Long-term project management with built in self-healing capabilities
managed by agent fleet.

This directory is meant to be managed by Openfleet agents, and is typically
not for humans, though it would be difficult to mess this up unintentionally.

## For Agents 🤖

Understand `## Structure`, then see `./status.md`, and other necessary
files before starting your current task.
